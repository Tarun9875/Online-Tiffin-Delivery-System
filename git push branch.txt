Got it 👍 That message means your frontend/ folder didn’t get staged for commit — only git push.txt is showing as untracked.

Let’s fix this step by step:

✅ Step 1: Make sure you’re in the project root
cd "D:\Internship Work\project\online-tiffin-app"

✅ Step 2: Check if the frontend/ folder exists
dir frontend


You should see your frontend project files inside (like package.json, src/, etc.).

✅ Step 3: Add only the frontend/ folder
git add frontend/*


If you also want to include hidden files (like .gitignore), run:

git add frontend

✅ Step 4: Commit
git commit -m "Add frontend code"

✅ Step 5: Push to branch
git push origin frontend


⚡ Question for you:
Do you want the frontend branch to only contain frontend code (and not backend at all), or should it still keep the backend code but highlight frontend work?
